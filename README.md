## 🏗 Projects

### **Post-Earthquake Structural Health Monitoring of Wat Arun**
*Non-invasive heritage assessment using 3D laser scanning*

* **3D Scanning & Analysis:** Processed post-earthquake 3D laser scanning data of the central prang and compared it with pre-event geometry to detect seismic-induced geometric deviations following the 28 March 2025 earthquake, establishing a baseline for structural condition assessment.
* **Material Benchmarking:** Designed and tested Thai heritage masonry mix proportions, determining mechanical properties and benchmarking them against traditional sticky-rice masonry formulations used in historic structures such as the Great Wall of China.
* **Model Validation:** Developed and validated a finite element model of masonry specimens, verifying numerical responses against experimental test data to ensure simulation reliability.
* **Seismic Simulation:** Built a finite element model of the central prang using processed scan geometry and experimentally derived material properties, evaluating its structural response under seismic loading from the 28 March 2025 earthquake.
* **Workflow Design:** Designed an end-to-end **Scan-to-FEM workflow** converting 3D laser scanning data into an accurate structural model of Wat Arun’s prang, enabling repeatable, non-invasive structural health monitoring aligned with UNESCO conservation principles.
