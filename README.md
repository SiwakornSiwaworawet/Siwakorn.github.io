# Projects

## Post-Earthquake Structural Health Monitoring of Wat Arun
<div style="text-align: justify">
Non-invasive heritage assessment using 3D laser scanning. We processed post-earthquake 3D scans to detect seismic deviations and designed Thai heritage masonry mixes to benchmark against historic structures.
</div>
<br>

**Key Features**
* **3D Scanning**: Processed post-earthquake data to identify geometric deviations.
* **Simulation**: Built a **Finite Element Model (FEM)** of the Prang to evaluate seismic response.
* **Material Testing**: Benchmarked mechanical properties against historic sticky-rice masonry.

## Vertical Axis Wind Turbine Design
<div style="text-align: justify">
Designed and optimized a high-efficiency Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) integrated with Arduino-based RPM sensing.
</div>
<br>

**Accomplishments**
* **Optimization**: Conducted wind velocity testing to improve aerodynamics.
* **Award**: Selected as **"Best of 3rd-Year Project"** by the faculty.
